## How to add to your server

Aryzona is not public yet.

## How to self host 

_The bot is written in GoLang, so you need the Go compiler._

_To store data, the bot uses Postgres, so you need to have a Postgres server running._


The bot supports loading the config from a `config.yml` file or from environment variables.
You need to pick one.

If you want to use a YAML file, create a `config.yml` file and copy the content of the 
`config.example.yml` file into it.

If you want to use environment variables, you can set them manually or in a `.env` file.
See the `.env.example` file for an example.

To start the bot, run `make run` or `go run .`.
